Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by [Vivek Sarkar](https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/) in the [Habanero Extreme Scale Software Research Laboratory](https://habanero.cc.gatech.edu/).
I'm interested in formal methods and verification broadly, but am focused specifically on equivalence between concurrent programs.
